    "\n",
    "What would be the time cost? For a string of length n, there are n!n! permutations (nn choices for the first character, times n-1n−1 choices for the second character, etc). Checking each length-nn permutation to see if it's a palindrome involves checking each character, taking O(n)O(n) time. That gives us O(n!n)O(n!n) time overall. We can do better!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try rephrasing the problem. How can we tell if any permutation of a string is a palindrome?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, how would we check that a string is a palindrome? We could use the somewhat-common \"keep two pointers\" pattern. We'd start a pointer at the beginning of the string and a pointer at the end of the string, and check that the characters at those pointers are equal as we walk both pointers towards the middle of the string.\n",

    "\n",
    "Can we adapt the idea behind this approach to checking if any permutation of a string is a palindrome?\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice: we're essentially checking that each character left of the middle has a corresponding copy right of the middle.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can simply check that each character appears an even number of times (unless there is a middle character, which can appear once or some other odd number of times). This ensures that the characters can be ordered so that each char on the left side of the string has a matching char on the right side of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we'll need a data structure to keep track of the number of times each character appears. What should we use?\n",
    "\n",
    "We could use a dictionary ↴ . (Tip: using a dictionary is the most common way to get from a brute force approach to something more clever. It should always be your first thought.)\n",
    "\n",
    "So we’ll go through all the characters and track how many times each character appears in the input string. Then we just have to make sure no more than one of the characters appears an odd numbers of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "That will give us a runtime of O(n)O(n), which is the best we can do since we have to look at a number of characters dependent on the length of the input string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, so we’ve reached our best run time. But can we still clean our solution up a little?\n",
    "\n",
    "We don’t really care how many times a character appears in the string, we just need to know whether the character appears an even or odd number of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if we just track whether or not each character appears an odd number of times? Then we can map characters to booleans. This will be more explicit (we don’t have to check each number’s parity, we already have booleans) and we’ll avoid the risk of integer overflow ↴ if some characters appear a high number of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we take this a step further and clean it up even more?\n",
    "\n",
    "Even more specifically than whether characters appear an even or odd number of times, we really just need to know there isn’t more than one character that appears an odd number of times.\n",
